PREFACE.


Maxims are general principles. General principles afford the most
beneficial subjects of reflection: hence it is obvious, that the memory
cannot be too well stored with Maxims. With regard to Law, Maxims are
the pillars upon which the system is erected. When the memory is stored
with them, the Lawyer can have no difficulty in his practice, to fill
up the outline.

The collection of Maxims here presented to the Public, is, I believe,
as extensive as any that has hitherto been published. I have omitted
none that I could discover to be of any utility. With regard to the
translation, it does not become me to say much. It has cost me some
labour, and I trust will be found to be useful. That it is in every
respect perfect, it would be wrong in me to suppose. I trust, however,
that on the whole it will be found pretty correct.

THE NATURE OF A RULE IN LAW.

Regula est quæ rem quæ est breviter enarrat, non ut ex regula jus
sumatur, sed ex jure, quod est, regula fiat. Per regulam igitur brevis
rerum narratio est, quæ, simul cum in aliquo vitiata est, perdit
officium suum.—L. 1. ff. de Regulis Juris Antiqui.


TRANSLATION.

A rule of law is a maxim inferred from several cases depending on the
same ground of law. The rule is formed from the law that governs these
cases, and not the law from the rule. And the rule must be applied duly
to the proper cases; for otherwise it loses its force, and is of no
significancy.

sequamur, quod in regione in qua actum est frequentatur. Quid ergo, si
neque regionis mos appareat quia varius fuit? ad id quod minimum est,
religenda summa est.

     Always in bargains, and in other contracts, we follow that
     which has been done, or if that does not appear which
     hath been done, the consequence will be that we should
     follow that which is usual in the country, in which it was
     performed: what therefore is necessary to be done, if the

     has been various; the sum is to be reduced, to that which

EXPLANATORY NOTE OF THE MAXIMS & RULES.


It will be observed, that this work is alphabetically arranged. At
first the author did not intend to refer to the authorities of the
Maxims and Rules, and it was not till after the printing was far
advanced, that he formed that resolution: but this obliged him, with
great labour, to make out the extensive appendix of reference in the
end of the work, consisting of ten close pages, and embracing, as will
be seen, from 40 to 50 most eminent and distinguished authorities; and
that they may be easily found, the appendix refers to the pages of
the book, in their order, and the numbers of each page, from the top
downwards.

above.

The corrections listed in the Errata have been made except where
the Errata entry is itself incorrect, as noted therein. Other obvious
